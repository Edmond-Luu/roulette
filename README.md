I am currently building a roulette game with React and Typescript. As of now, the game only has a roulette wheel and a spinning functionalty. However, I plan to add a betting system in the future. The betting system will only start with color and even/odd betting and will gradually expand to other bets (i.e., precise numbers, number ranges, etc.).
